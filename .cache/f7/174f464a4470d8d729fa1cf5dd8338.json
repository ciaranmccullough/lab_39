of Lab 39 Ltd. In this document, \"we\",\n          \"our\", or \"us\" refer to Lab 39 Ltd. We are company number 04375159\n          registered in United Kingdom. Our registered office is at 30a Wimpole\n          Street, London W1G 8YA.\n        </p>\n        <h4>Introduction</h4>\n        <p>\n          1. This is a notice to inform you of our policy about all information\n          that we record about you. It sets out the conditions under which we\n          may process any information that we collect from you, or that you\n          provide to us. It covers information that could identify you\n          (“personal information”) and information that could not. In the\n          context of the law and this notice, “process” means collect, store,\n          transfer, use or otherwise act on information.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          2. We regret that if there are one or more points below with which you\n          are not happy, your only recourse is to leave our website immediately.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          3. We take seriously the protection of your privacy and\n          confidentiality. We understand that all visitors to our website are\n          entitled to know that their personal data will not be used for any\n          purpose unintended by them, and will not accidentally fall into the\n          hands of a third party.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          4. We undertake to preserve the confidentiality of all information you\n          provide to us, and hope that you reciprocate.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          5. Our policy complies with UK law accordingly implemented, including\n          that required by the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          6. The law requires us to tell you about your rights and our\n          obligations to you in regards to the processing and control of your\n          personal data. We do this now, by requesting that you read the\n          information provided at www.knowyourprivacyrights.org\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          7. Except as set out below, we do not share, or sell, or disclose to a\n          third party, any information collected through our website. The bases\n          on which we process information about you The law requires us to\n          determine under which of six defined bases we process different\n          categories of your personal information, and to notify you of the\n          basis for each category. If a basis on which we process your personal\n          information is no longer relevant then we shall immediately stop\n          processing your data. If the basis changes then if required by law we\n          shall notify you of the change and of any new basis under which we\n          have determined that we can continue to process your information.\n        </p>\n        <h4>\n          1. Information we process because we have a contractual obligation\n          with you\n        </h4>\n        <p>\n          When you create an account on our website, buy a product or service\n          from us, or otherwise agree to our terms and conditions, a contract is\n          formed between you and us. In order to carry out our obligations under\n          that contract we must process the information you give us. Some of\n          this information may be personal information.\n        </p>\n        <p>We may use it in order to:</p>\n        <p>1.1. verify your identity for security purposes</p>\n        <p>1.2. sell products to you</p>\n        <p>1.3. provide you with our services</p>\n        <p>\n          1.4. provide you with suggestions and advice on products, services and\n          how to obtain the most from using our website We process this\n          information on the basis there is a contract between us, or that you\n          have requested we use the information before we enter into a legal\n          contract.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Additionally, we may aggregate this information in a general way and\n          use it to provide class information, for example to monitor our\n          performance with respect to a particular service we provide. If we use\n          it for this purpose, you as an individual will not be personally\n          identifiable.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We shall continue to process this information until the contract\n          between us ends or is terminated by either party under the terms of\n          the contract.\n        </p>\n        <h4>2. Information we process with your consent</h4>\n        <p>\n          Through certain actions when otherwise there is no contractual\n          relationship between us, such as when you browse our website or ask us\n          to provide you more information about our business, including job\n          opportunities and our products and services, you provide your consent\n          to us to process information that may be personal information.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Wherever possible, we aim to obtain your explicit consent to process\n          this information, for example, by asking you to agree to our use of\n          cookies.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Sometimes you might give your consent implicitly, such as when you\n          send us a message by e-mail to which you would reasonably expect us to\n          reply.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Except where you have consented to our use of your information for a\n          specific purpose, we do not use your information in any way that would\n          identify you personally. We may aggregate it in a general way and use\n          it to provide class information, for example to monitor the\n          performance of a particular page on our website.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If you have given us explicit permission to do so, we may from time to\n          time pass your name and contact information to selected associates\n          whom we consider may provide services or products you would find\n          useful.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We continue to process your information on this basis until you\n          withdraw your consent or it can be reasonably assumed that your\n          consent no longer exists.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          You may withdraw your consent at any time by instructing us at\n          admin@lab39.co.uk. However, if you do so, you may not be able to use\n          our website or our services further.\n        </p>\n        <h4>3. Information we process because we have a legal obligation</h4>\n        <p>\n          We are subject to the law like everyone else. Sometimes, we must\n          process your information in order to comply with a statutory\n          obligation. For example, we may be required to give information to\n          legal authorities if they so request or if they have the proper\n          authorisation such as a search warrant or court order.\n        </p>\n        <p>This may include your personal information.</p>\n        <p>Specific uses of information you provide to us</p>\n        <h4>\n          4. Information provided on the understanding that it will be shared\n          with a third party\n        </h4>\n        <p>\n          Our website allows you to post information with a view to that\n          information being read, copied, downloaded, or used by other people.\n          Examples include:\n        </p>\n        <p>4.1. posting a message our forum</p>\n        <p>4.2. tagging an image</p>\n        <p>\n          4.3. clicking on an icon next to another visitor’s message to convey\n          your agreement, disagreement or thanks In posting personal\n          information, it is up to you to satisfy yourself about the privacy\n          level of every person who might use it. We do store it, and we reserve\n          a right to use it in the future in any way we decide.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Once your information enters the public domain, we have no control\n          over what any individual third party may do with it. We accept no\n          responsibility for their actions at any time.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          Provided your request is reasonable and there is no legal basis for us\n          to retain it, then at our discretion we may agree to your request to\n          delete personal information that you have posted. You can make a\n          request by contacting us at admin@lab39.co.uk.\n        </p>\n        <h4>5. Complaints regarding content on our website</h4>\n        <p>\n          If you complain about any of the content on our website, we shall\n          investigate your complaint.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If we feel it is justified or if we believe the law requires us to do\n          so, we shall remove the content while we investigate. Free speech is a\n          fundamental right, so we have to make a judgment as to whose right\n          will be obstructed: yours, or that of the person who posted the\n          content that offends you.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          If we think your complaint is vexatious or without any basis, we shall\n          not correspond with you about it.\n        </p>\n        <h4>6. Information relating to your method of payment</h4>\n        <h4>7. Information about your direct debit</h4>\n        <p>\n          When you agree to set up a direct debit arrangement, the information\n          you give to us is passed to our own bank Barclays for processing\n          according to our instructions. We do not keep a copy.\n        </p>\n        <p>\n          We are registered under the direct debit guarantee scheme. This\n          provides for the customer's bank to refund disputed payments without\n          question, pending further investigation. Direct debits can only be set\n          up for payments to beneficiaries that are approved originators of\n          direct debits. In order to be approved, these beneficiaries are\n          subjected to careful vetting procedures. Once approved, they are\n          required to give indemnity guarantees through their banks.\n        </p>\n        <h4>8.
